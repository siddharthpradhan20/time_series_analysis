## Project Overview

The **Stock Price Prediction** project leverages time series forecasting models to predict the future prices of stocks, enabling investors and traders to make informed, data-driven decisions. By analyzing historical stock prices, the model identifies patterns and trends, helping to anticipate future market movements. 

The key goals of this project are:
- To provide **reliable** stock price predictions using time series models.
- To ensure **data integrity** and high-quality analysis for accurate forecasting.
- To enable investors to optimize their **investment strategies** based on predictions.

---

## Features

- **Time Series Forecasting**: Built using Auto-ARIMA, the project can predict future stock prices based on historical data.
- **Data Visualization**: The app provides visualizations of stock price trends, patterns, and predictions.
- **Investor Insights**: Helps investors make data-driven decisions by analyzing stock trends over time.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assesses the accuracy of stock predictions using standard evaluation metrics like MAPE and RMSE.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels (for Auto-ARIMA), Scikit-learn
- **Time Series Analysis**: Auto-ARIMA, ADF Test (for stationarity)
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Deployment**: Jupyter Notebooks (for development), Flask (for web deployment, optional)

---

## Data Pipeline

1. **Data Collection**: Historical stock price data is gathered from publicly available sources (e.g., Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage API).
  
2. **Data Preparation**:
   - **Missing Value Handling**: Ensures no missing or anomalous values in the stock price data.
   - **Feature Engineering**: Generated useful features such as stock price returns, moving averages, and volatility for better model accuracy.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualized stock price trends over time.
   - Performed stationarity tests (ADF Test) to ensure that the data is suitable for time series modeling.
   - Identified seasonality and trends in the data using moving averages.

4. **Data Transformation**:
   - **Differencing**: Applied differencing to make the time series stationary.
   - **Log Transformation**: Used to stabilize the variance in stock prices.
   - **Scaling**: Normalized the data for better performance of the ARIMA model.

## Modeling

### 1. **Auto-ARIMA Model**
   - Automatically identifies the best parameters (p, d, q) for the ARIMA model based on the stock price data.
   - Trains a forecasting model on historical data and predicts future stock prices.

### 2. **Model Training**:
   - The Auto-ARIMA algorithm automatically tunes the model's parameters to fit the time series data optimally.
   - Trained on historical stock prices to predict future prices for a specified time horizon (e.g., 30 days ahead).

### 3. **Model Validation**:
   - The model's performance is validated using **cross-validation** on different slices of the time series data.
   - Forecasted results are compared to actual stock prices to assess accuracy.

---

## Evaluation Metrics

The model is evaluated using the following metrics to ensure high-quality and accurate stock price predictions:

- **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**: Measures the accuracy of predictions relative to actual values.
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Measures the deviation between predicted stock prices and actual prices.
- **R² Score**: Assesses how well the model captures the variability of stock prices.

The **Auto-ARIMA** model provided a robust R² score and performed exceptionally well, giving reliable predictions for future stock prices.
